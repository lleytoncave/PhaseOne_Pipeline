## Project Description

[A pipeline to process imagery from the phase one camera. This system has a high resolution rgb camera and generates a large amount of data that needs to be handled efficiently. The pipeline outline consists of a few steps:

1 - Downsamples of raw iiq files while maintaining all metadata. This step is done using Imagemagick which natively supports IIQ image files from the phase one.

2 - Run downsampled images through agisoft to align cameras and estimate extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters for reverse calculation of the plot boundaries from the raw images

3 - To implement with code from Lukas using the Phase One SDK to optimise denoising and resolution. In this step will specify plot bounds from agisoft output adjusting for dowsampling in step 1.

4 - This should hopefully generate high resoltuion plot clip photos for tasks like object detection and segmentation with a known area or gsd that can allow calculation of traits with a refernce to area, ex. Plants per m2.]
